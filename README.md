The aim was to build a model that could handle legal language intricacies and produce persuasive arguments or summaries effectively. 
The project involves fine-tuning GPT-2, a well-known language model, to generate legal text based on prompts provided by the user. 
The key objective is to create a system that can generate legal arguments or conclusions from given legal scenarios, which can be used for drafting legal documents or assisting in legal research. 
The project uses a dataset of legal cases to train the model, ensuring that the generated text is relevant and contextually appropriate.
This project highlights the potential of fine-tuning language models for specialized tasks such as legal text generation. 
By leveraging advanced NLP techniques and tools, the project aims to offer a valuable resource for legal professionals and researchers, providing a model that can assist in drafting and analyzing legal documents.
To showcase the model’s capabilities, screenshots of the model’s responses to three different prompts are included.
Each screenshot demonstrates how the model generates text based on varied legal prompts, illustrating its ability to handle different scenarios and provide relevant responses.
